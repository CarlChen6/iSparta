# Develop

iSparta use [nw.js](https://nwjs.io/) framework to develop. You need [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. Using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to install on macOS, official installer to install on Windows.

Install node dependencies:

```bash
cd iSparta/src
npm install
```

Because `nw.js` provide a binary bundle for each platform, and its' size is large. So we do not keep the binary bundle into git repo. Go to [nw.js release](https://dl.nwjs.io/v0.12.3/) to download. Currently we use `nwjs-v0.12.3` to build.

Then, unzip the downloaded binary bundle, keep the extracted files at the same level of `package.json`, then run the program:

```bash
nwjs.app/Contents/MacOS/nwjs ./
```

You can execute `nwjs.exe` on Windows.

# Package

According to [nwjs docs](https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js/wiki/how-to-package-and-distribute-your-apps), you need to download the binary bundle for target platform. Then create a directory named `build`, copy these files in the project folder files into `build`:

+ `app`
+ `node_modules`
+ `package.json`

on macOS, move the `build` directory into binary bundle and rename to `app.nw`, then package the entire folder.

```bash
mv build nwjs.app/Contents/Resources/app.nw
zip -r iSparta-mac.zip nwjs.app
```

on Windowsä¸Š, move the `build` directory into the same level as `nwjs.exe` and rename it to `package.nw`. Then package the entire folder.

The application icon is under `icon` directory, you can use them as needed.
